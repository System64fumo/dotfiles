# Background info
I don't really rice much these days but since some people like to take insperation i guess i could update this every once and a while.<br>
My desktop mostly consists of my own shell so the css doesn't differ all that much from stock.<br>
You can expect good support for both desktop and mobile usecases as i also happen to use a linux phone (Oneplus 6t)
